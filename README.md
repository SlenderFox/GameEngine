# SRender

Can be compiled on Windows with Visual Studio (msvc)

Can be compile on Linux with makefile (gcc)

Project originally started with me following https://learnopengl.com/

### Libraries used:
- OpenGL core 3.3 via glad ([Website](https://glad.dav1d.de/))
- GLFW ([Website](https://www.glfw.org/download.html))
- GLM ([Website](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html))
- stb_image.h ([Github](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h))
- Assimp ([Github](https://github.com/assimp/assimp))

I would like to have the libraries as a github dependancy but idk how to do that so this will suffice for now
